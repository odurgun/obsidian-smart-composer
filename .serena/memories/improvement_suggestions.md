# Project Improvement Suggestions

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Obsidian Smart Composer codebase, here are prioritized recommendations for improvement:

## Critical Issues (Fix First)

### 1. Memory Leak Resolution
**Current Issue**: Memory leak during plugin reloading affects development experience
**Impact**: Development becomes unresponsive after multiple reloads
**Solution**:
- Audit React component cleanup in ChatView.tsx and ApplyView.tsx
- Check for event listener cleanup in main.ts
- Review database connection cleanup in DatabaseManager.ts
- Add memory monitoring utilities for development

### 2. Language Server Integration
**Current Issue**: Symbol indexing tools failing with "Invalid request parameters"
**Impact**: Advanced code navigation and refactoring tools unavailable
**Solution**:
- Investigate MCP tool parameter validation
- Consider alternative language server integration
- Add fallback symbol search using regex patterns
- Document current limitations for contributors

### 3. ESM/CommonJS Compatibility
**Current Issue**: PGlite shim may cause issues with other libraries
**Impact**: Potential conflicts with future dependencies
**Solution**:
- Monitor for library conflicts and document issues
- Consider migrating to native ESM if Obsidian supports it
- Create comprehensive compatibility testing
- Add warnings in documentation about potential issues

## High Priority Improvements

### 4. Testing Coverage Expansion
**Current State**: Jest configured but limited test coverage
**Recommended Actions**:
- Add unit tests for core LLM providers (src/core/llm/)
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Add integration tests for database operations
- Test MCP functionality with mocked servers
- Create end-to-end tests for chat workflows

### 5. Performance Optimization
**Areas for Improvement**:
- Bundle Size: Analyze and optimize esbuild output
- Database Queries: Add query optimization and caching
- React Rendering: Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Memory Usage: Add memory profiling for large vaults
- Lazy Loading: Implement code splitting for settings sections

### 6. Developer Experience Enhancement
**Improvements Needed**:
- Error Boundaries: Add React error boundaries for better debugging
- Development Tools: Enhanced logging and debugging utilities
- Hot Reload: Improve plugin reloading reliability
- Documentation: More comprehensive API documentation
- Type Safety: Reduce any types and improve type definitions

## Medium Priority Enhancements

### 7. Feature Completeness
**Potential Additions**:
- Offline Support: Better handling when API keys unavailable
- Batch Operations: Bulk apply suggestions, bulk template operations
- Advanced RAG: Custom embedding models, hybrid search
- Collaboration: Shared chat sessions, export functionality
- Accessibility: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation

### 8. Code Organization
**Refactoring Opportunities**:
- Component Library: Extract reusable UI components
- Custom Hooks: Consolidate related state logic
- Utility Functions: Better organization of helper functions
- Constants: Centralized configuration management
- Error Handling: Standardized error types and handling

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- Build Time: Target < 30 seconds for full builds
- Test Coverage: Aim for > 80% coverage
- Bundle Size: Monitor and optimize JavaScript bundle
- Memory Usage: No memory leaks in development
- Type Safety: Zero TypeScript errors in strict mode

### User Experience Metrics
- Load Time: Plugin initialization < 2 seconds
- Response Time: AI responses within user expectations
- Error Rate: Minimal runtime errors
- Feature Usage: High adoption of advanced features
- User Satisfaction: Positive feedback and low churn
