## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Development Environment
- **Hot Reloading**: Available but needs testing
- **Database Migration**: System ready but not actively used
- **Testing Suite**: Configured but needs to run tests
- **Build Process**: Configured but needs verification

### Code Quality
- **Linting Setup**: Configured and ready to use
- **Type Checking**: Configured and ready to use
- **Testing Framework**: Configured but needs test execution
- **Documentation**: Partially updated, needs maintenance

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Development Setup**:
   - Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies
   - Execute `npm run dev` to start development server
   - Test hot reloading functionality
   - Verify Obsidian plugin loading

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Run `npm run lint:check` to verify code quality
   - Execute `npm run type:check` for TypeScript validation
   - Run `npm test` to verify test suite
   - Test `npm run build` for production readiness

3. **Database Verification**:
   - Test database initialization in Obsidian
   - Verify migration system functionality
   - Check JSON fallback mechanism
   - Test vector storage for RAG features

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Development**:
   - Implement planned features from roadmap
   - Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation for new features
   - Follow established code patterns

2. **Code Maintenance**:
   - Address known memory leak issues
   - Monitor ESM/CommonJS compatibility
   - Optimize performance for large vaults
   - Enhance error handling and user feedback

3. **Quality Improvements**:
   - Expand test coverage
   - Improve documentation completeness
   - Optimize build and development performance
   - Enhance development experience

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Development

### Development Commands Available
- **Start Development**: `npm run dev` (with hot reloading)
- **Build Production**: `npm run build`
- **Code Quality**: `npm run lint:check`, `npm run lint:fix`
- **Type Checking**: `npm run type:check`
- **Testing**: `npm test`
- **Database**: `npx drizzle-kit generate`, `npm run migrate:compile`
- **Versioning**: `npm run version`

### Tools and Systems Ready
- **Obsidian Integration**: Plugin architecture configured
- **React Components**: UI system ready for development
- **Database System**: PGlite with migrations operational
- **AI Integration**: Multiple providers configured
- **Build System**: esbuild with development and production modes
- **Quality Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest active

### Architecture Understanding
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Load/unload and initialization patterns
- **View System**: Chat and Apply views with proper integration
- **Context Management**: React contexts for state management
